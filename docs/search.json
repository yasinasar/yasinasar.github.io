I have been a faculty member in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences in Necmettin Erbakan University since 2011. Furthermore, I visited the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in McMaster University as a post-doctoral research fellow in 2018-2019. The main topic was censored data analysis and I have written two papers, one is regarding the progressively type-I hybrid censoring scheme and the other one was about joint censoring.\nI have a PhD in Statistics. I have been studying different kinds of regression models and the problem of multicollinearity. In my Ph.D. thesis, I have studied different biased estimation methods to overcome the collinearity problem.\nNowadays, I am focused on machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence. Moreover, I like coding in R and Python but R is my favorite programming language.\nIn the department, I mostly deal with probability, statistics, numerical analysis and data analysis courses.\nI married to Hülya Asar and I have two daughters, Sevdenur and Elif Reyyan.\n \n  \n   \n  \n    \n     Email\n  \n  \n    \n     ORCID\n  \n  \n    \n     ResearchGate\n  \n  \n    \n     LinkedIn\n  \n  \n    \n     GitHub\n  \n  \n    \n     Scholar\n  \n  \n    \n     CV"
